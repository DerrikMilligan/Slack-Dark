# Slack-Dark
Taken initially from the [ArchLinux package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/slack-desktop-dark/).

Now they're using [this new repo](https://github.com/caiceA/slack-raw) for the styling. That repo had a better install script, which I found modifications that should make it work on any OS.

# Prerequisites
 - Download and install this font: [Muli Font](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/download/muli)
 - Make sure the node `asar` package is installed `npm install -g asar`
